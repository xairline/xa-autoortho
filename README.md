## HOW TO INSTALL

1. Download [latest version](https://github.com/xairline/xa-autoortho/releases/latest) from github
2. Make sure [macfuse](https://osxfuse.github.io/) is properly installed
3. The zip file has 5 files, remove Mac quarantine flags on all of them. ``perm.sh`` can be used to do this, just make sure you run it in the unzipped folder.
4. Copy the unzipped folder into xplane plugins folder
5. (For now) use the autoortho (without icon) to open autoortho UI so you can install regions/change config. 
    > NOTE: DO NOT USE UI TO RUN AUTOORTHO

    > NOTE: UI IS ONLY FOR INSTALLING REGIONS OR CHANGING CONFIG
6. once 5 is done, launch xplane
